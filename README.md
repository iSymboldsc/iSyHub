# 📡 Main Purpose 📡
So basically this is just used to host my, well, scripts for Roblox "games".

---
# ✌️ Why this is better than everything else (obviously) ✌️
* All the code is organized *neatly* in the README for easy access.
* We don't obfuscate our code, so you know exactly what's going on.
* All pull requests are obviously checked for virus, or malicious code.
* Scripts are keyless, obviously.
